%matlab.system.mixin.Nondirect Mixin to control direct feedthrough
%   The Nondirect mixin is used to allow System objects to be used in 
%   feedback loops in Simulink.  If a System object's output does not 
%   directly depend on its input, use the Nondirect mixin to enable output 
%   and update methods to be used in addition to the step method.  The 
%   output method calculates outputs from states and/or inputs while the 
%   update method updates state values from inputs.  
%   
%   The Nondirect mixin is used in a System object in the MATLAB System
%   Block to break algebraic loops in Simulink by separating output
%   processing from update processing and for controlling direct feedthrough.  
%   If the System object supports code generation and it does not inherit 
%   from the Propagates mixin, Simulink can automatically infer the direct 
%   feedthrough settings from the System object MATLAB code.
%   If the System object supports code generation and inherits from the 
%   Propagates mixin, Simulink doesn't automatically infer direct feedthrough 
%   setting, and relies on isInputDirectFeedthroughImpl method.
%   If the System object does not support code generation, the default 
%   isInputDirectFeedthrough will return false (no directfeedthrough).
%
%   To use this mixin, subclass from the Nondirect class in addition 
%   to the matlab.System base class. Use the following syntax as the first
%   line of your class definition file,  where ObjectName is the name of
%   your object:
%   
%   classdef ObjectName < matlab.System &...
%       matlab.system.mixin.Nondirect
