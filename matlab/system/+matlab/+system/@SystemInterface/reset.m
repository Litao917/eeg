%RESET Reset the internal states of a System object
%   reset(OBJ) resets the internal states of System object OBJ to their
%   initial values.
%
%   Objects that have internal states will describe in their help
%   what the reset method does for that object.  System objects 
%   with no states are unaffected by reset.
