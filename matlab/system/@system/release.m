%RELEASE Allow property value and input characteristics changes
%   release(OBJ) releases system resources (such as memory, file handles or
%   hardware connections) of System object, OBJ, and allows all its
%   properties and input characteristics to be changed.
%
%   Once you call the release method on a System object, subsequent calls
%   to setup, step, reset, or release are not supported for code
%   generation.
