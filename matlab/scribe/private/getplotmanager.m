%   H = GETPLOTMANAGER
%   With no arguments, returns the singleton plotmanager. If no plotmanager
%   was previously created, one will be created. 
%
%   H = GETPLOTMANAGER('-peek') 
%   The '-peek' flag by-passes plotmanager creation so that no plotmanager
%   objects is implicitly created. This syntax will return an
%   empty output if no plotmanager object was previously instantiated.
%
%   The following example adds a listener to the plotmanager singleton
%   which is updates in response to selection of a graphic object in any
%   figure
%
%   plotmgr = feval(graph2dhelper('getplotmanager'));
%   li = handle.listener(plotmgr,'PlotSelectionChange',@(es,ed) disp(ed));
