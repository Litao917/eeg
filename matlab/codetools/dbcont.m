%DBCONT Resume execution
%   The DBCONT command resumes execution of a file following a stop in
%   execution caused by either a DBSTOP or DBSTEP command.  Execution will
%   continue until either another breakpoint is encountered, an error
%   occurs, or MATLAB returns to the base workspace prompt.
