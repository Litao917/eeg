    % BooleanConstraint - Interface for boolean combinations of Constraints
    %
    %   The BooleanConstraint interface is a sub-interface of Constraint which
    %   allows constraints to be combined to form a boolean algebra. In
    %   particular, any constraint which derives from BooleanConstraint is able
    %   to be combined and negated using the AND (&), OR (|), and NOT (~)
    %   operators of the MATLAB language.
    %
    %   Classes which derive from the BooleanConstraint interface must
    %   implement everything required by the standard Constraint interface. In
    %   addition, it also must provide a means to provide a Diagnostic for the
    %   negative case. This is because when a given constraint is negated the
    %   diagnostics must be provided or written in a different form than the
    %   form presented upon a standard (non-negated) failure.
    %
    %   In exchange for meeting these requirements, all BooleanConstraint
    %   implementations inherit the appropriate MATLAB overloads for AND, OR,
    %   and NOT so that they can be combined with other BooleanConstraints to
    %   form a full boolean algebra.
    %
    %   BooleanConstraint methods:
    %       getNegativeDiagnosticFor - produce a negated diagnostic for a value
    %       not - the logical negation of a boolean constraint
    %       and - the logical conjunction of a boolean constraint
    %       or - the logical disjunction of a boolean constraint
    %

    % classdef HasSameSizeAs < matlab.unittest.constraints.BooleanConstraint
    %     % HasSameSizeHas - an example boolean constraint
    %     %
    %     %   Simple example to demonstrate how to create a custom
    %     %   constraint. This constraint determines whether a
    %     %   given value is the same size as some expected value.
    %     %
    %     %   It is suggested to make BooleanConstraint implementations immutable
    %     %   (unchangeable) after construction, which is why the example
    %     %   property is private.
    %
    %     properties(Access=private)

    %         ValueWithExpectedSize

    %     methods(Access=protected)
    %
    %         function diag = getNegativeDiagnosticFor(constraint, actual)
    %             % getNegativeDiagnosticFor - produce a diagnostic when the constraint is incorrectly met
    %             %
    %             %   This method is called by the testing framework when the constraint has
    %             %   been met but should not have been met because it was negated in a
    %             %   boolean expression. It should produce a Diagnostic result that
    %             %   describes the failure in the correct terms which express the
    %             %   requirement that the constraint actually should not have been met.

    %             %   The HasSameSizeAs constructor takes the value to compare size against

    %             %   The satisfiedBy method should be a fast determination of whether or not
    %             %   the constraint was met by the actual value provided. This method should
    %             %   be as fast as possible, optimized for the passing case.
