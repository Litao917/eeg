function tf = licensed(parts, schema)
% LICENSED Are the all the parts covered by a valid license?
%
% PARTS: Cell-array of strings. (Or a single string.)
% SCHEMA: A Schema object; set of heuristics influencing dependency analysis.
%
% Licensing in a deployed application is fundamentally different than
% licensing in MATLAB: the license manager is not deployed. That means all
% license management decisions must be made at application build time and 
% none may be deferred until runtime. Consequences:
%
%  1) LICENSED returns true for those normally-licensed functions for which
%     a license is available in the current MATLAB session. Normal licenses
%     have the same effect on function execution in deployed applications as
%     they do in MATLAB -- that is, the absence of a license prevents the
%     function from being included in the deployed application, and therefore
%     prevents its execution.
%
%  2) Shared-license functions (see src/services/lmgr/lmgrdata.xml) depend
%     on the runtime call-tree for authorization (in the interesting case, 
%     where a normal license is not available but a shared license is).
%     Deployed applications have no license manager, and cannot manage 
%     entitlements at runtime. Consequences:
%
%       a) LICENSED uses the transitive closure of the authorizing functions
%          as a proxy for the runtime call tree. A function with a shared
%          license is included in the deployed application if its authorizing
%          function appears in the 
%
%       b) Non-authorized clients may call any shared function included in
%          the deployed application.
%
% Deployed applications offer a weaker guarantee for shared functions. In
% theory this opens a security hole. In practice however, this hole is kept
% mostly closed by the in-MATLAB behavior. Developing an application in which
% non-authorized clients call shared functions is difficult, since the 
% application will not run in MATLAB. It is possible, however, and will
% remain possible unless and until the MCR provides runtime license management.
%
%
% Algorithm:
%   Inputs: List of parts, Schema object
%
%   1) Determine the components that own the parts.
%   2) Query MATLAB to determine which components have available licenses.
%   3) Filter the parts against the licenses.
%   4) Examine the licensed functions for authorized clients.
%   5) Temporarily enable licenses for appropriate (authorized) shared 
%      function providers (components that provide shared functions to the
%      authorized functions).
%   6) If any new licenses added to list and unlicensed functions remain,
%      go back to step 3).

    % of P-files will no longer be 0. 
    %
    % We are not going to write P-files into Table
