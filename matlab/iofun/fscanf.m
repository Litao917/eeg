%FSCANF Read data from text file.
%   [A,COUNT] = FSCANF(FID,FORMAT) reads and converts data from a text file
%   into array A in column order. FID is a file identifier obtained from
%   FOPEN. COUNT is an optional output argument that returns the number of
%   elements successfully read.
%
%   FORMAT is a string containing ordinary characters and/or conversion
%   specifications, which include a % character, an optional asterisk for 
%   assignment suppression, an optional width field, and a conversion
%   character (such as d, i, o, u, x, e, f, g, s, or c).
%
%   FSCANF reapplies the FORMAT throughout the entire file. If FSCANF
%   cannot match the FORMAT to the data, it reads only the portion that
%   matches into A and then stops processing. For more details on the 
%   FORMAT input, type "doc fscanf" at the command prompt.
%
%   [A,COUNT] = FSCANF(FID,FORMAT,SIZEA) reads SIZEA elements into A.
%   Valid forms for SIZEA are:
%
%      inf    Read to the end of the file. (default)
%      N      Read at most N elements into a column vector.
%      [M,N]  Read at most M * N elements filling at least an M-by-N matrix
%             in column order. N can be inf, but M cannot.
%
%   Notes:
%
%   MATLAB reads characters using the encoding scheme associated with 
%   the file. See FOPEN for more information. MATLAB converts characters in
%   both the FORMAT string and in the file to the internal character
%   representation before comparing.
%
%   Examples:
%
%   File count.dat contains three columns of integers. Read the values in
%   column order, and transpose to match the appearance of the file:
%
%       fid = fopen('count.dat');
%       A = fscanf(fid,'%d',[3,inf])';
%       fclose(fid);
%
%    Read the contents of plus.m into a character string:
%
%       fid = fopen('plus.m');
%       S = fscanf(fid,'%s');
%       fclose(fid);
