%MIMOFR	 Linear time-invariant frequency response.
%   MIMOFR has been removed.
%
%   H = MIMOFR(A,B,C,E,S) calculates the frequency response of the
%   continuous- or discrete-time system:
%
%   	 G(s) = C*(s*E - A)\B
%
%   for the complex frequencies in vector S.  You can set C=[] or E=[]
%   when C or E are the identity matrix.
