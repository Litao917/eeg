%displayNonScalarObject    Display format for non-scalar objects
%   displayNonScalarObject(A) is called by the DISP method when the object
%   array A is non-scalar (i.e., PROD(SIZE(A)) > 1). The default display
%   of a non-scalar object array consists of a header and list of 
%   properties.  The properties are shown in the order that they are
%   defined in the class definition. 
%
%   Override this method to customize the appearance a non-scalar object
%   array.
