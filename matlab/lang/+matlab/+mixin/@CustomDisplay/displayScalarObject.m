%displayScalarObject Display format for scalar objects
%   displayScalarObject(A) is called by the DISP method when the object
%   array is scalar (i.e., PROD(SIZE(A) == 1). The default display of a
%   scalar object array consists of a header and a list of properties and
%   their values.  Properties are shown in the order that they are defined
%   in the class definition.  Only visible properties with public
%   GetAccess are shown.

%   Override this method to customize the appearance of a scalar object
%   array.

%   consists of the object's dimensions and the properties are shown in
%   the order defined in the class definition. Only visible properties
%   with public GetAccess are shown.
