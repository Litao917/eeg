%getFooter Build and return display footer text
%   S = getFooter(A) builds and returns the text used as the footer when
%   displaying the object array A.  This method is called once each time A
%   is displayed.
%
%   Override this method when a custom footer is needed.  The overriding
%   implementation must support all of the possible states an object array
%   might be in, including scalar, non-scalar, empty, and deleted (if A is
%   an instance of a handle class). 
%  
%   The default implementation returns an empty string.
