%ERFCX Scaled complementary error function.
%   Y = ERFCX(X) is the scaled complementary error function for each
%   element of X.  X must be real.  The scaled complementary error
%   function is defined as: 
%
%     erfcx(x) = exp(x^2) * erfc(x)
%
%   which is approximately (1/sqrt(pi)) * 1/x for large x.
%
%   See also ERF, ERFC, ERFINV, ERFCINV.
