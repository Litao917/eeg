%CSCD   Cosecant of argument in degrees.
%   CSCD(X) is the cosecant of the elements of X, expressed in degrees.
%   For integers n, cscd(n*180) is infinite, whereas csc(n*pi) is large
%   but finite, reflecting the accuracy of the floating point value for pi.
%
%   Class support for input X:
%      float: double, single
