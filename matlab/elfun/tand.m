%TAND   Tangent of argument in degrees.
%   TAND(X) is the tangent of the elements of X, expressed in degrees.
%   For odd integers n, tand(n*90) is infinite, whereas tan(n*pi/2) is large
%   but finite, reflecting the accuracy of the floating point value of pi.
%
%   Class support for input X:
%      float: double, single
