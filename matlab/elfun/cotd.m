%COTD   Cotangent of argument in degrees.
%   COTD(X) is the cotangent of the elements of X, expressed in degrees.
%   For integers n, cotd(n*180) is infinite, whereas cot(n*pi) is large
%   but finite, reflecting the accuracy of the floating point value of pi.
%
%   Class support for input X:
%      float: double, single
